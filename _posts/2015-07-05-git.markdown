Git, the version control system, can include files in any encoding. Diffs are easier to
read when the files use ASCII text.

Git does not support right-to-left text in commit messages.

## GitHub

GitHub is a website based on the git version control system. GitHub supports only ASCII in project names. As with git, right-to-left text cannot be used in commit messages.
