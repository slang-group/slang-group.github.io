You can internationalize your maps in several different mapping frameworks.

## Google Maps API

Using the right language settings with the Google Maps API allows your users to see map labels and directions in their own language.

## MapBox Studio / TileMill

If your users might not have the right fonts to see your map labels, you can use a
tile service like MapBox Studio / TileMill to generate image tiles.

First, install the right language font on your computer.

## MapBoxGL

Labels in MapBoxGL are rendered as text by the browser. The user may need a
web font installed to show your labels.
