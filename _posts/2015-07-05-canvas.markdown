The HTML5 Canvas element can be used to render graphics and text from JavaScript. Here are some pointers for supporting multilingual text in Canvas.

### Fonts

Canvas can only support characters which are available on the user's computer. You should include
and use web fonts to maximize language support.

### Text Width and Height

When working with non-monospaced fonts, or with diacritic/accent/modifier characters, it is difficult to estimate the width of a string of text only from the length.

Use Canvas's built-in method, ctx.measureText(STRING) to measure width and height of the text that you are about to print.

### Right-to-Left Text

When you use fillText with right-to-left text, [put the cursor at the rightmost part of the line and use &lt;canvas dir="rtl"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8961636/html5-canvas-filltext-with-right-to-left-string).

### Vertical Text

Vertical text is currently not supported in Canvas.
