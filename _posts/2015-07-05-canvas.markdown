The HTML5 Canvas element can be used to render text. Here are some pointers for supporting multilingual text in Canvas.

### Fonts

Canvas can only support characters which are available on the user's computer. You should include
and use web fonts to maximize language support.

### Text Width and Height

When working with non-monospaced fonts, or with diacritic/accent characters, it is difficult
to estimate the width of a string of text only from the number of characters.

Use Canvas's built-in method, ctx.measureText("string") to measure width and height of the text
that you are about to print.

### Right-to-Left Text

When you use fillText with right-to-left text, [put the cursor at the rightmost part of the line and use &lt;canvas dir="rtl"&gt;&lt;/canvas&gt;](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8961636/html5-canvas-filltext-with-right-to-left-string).

### Vertical Text

Vertical text is not natively supported in Canvas. Use the ctx.measureText method to go
character-by-character through a string, keeping in place for diacritics/accents.
