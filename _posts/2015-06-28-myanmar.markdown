Myanmar (Burmese) has its own script and is Unicode-supported.

Many people use a non-Unicode-compliant font called Zawgyi to enter data into systems.
Fortunately, there are several scripts to detect and convert Zawgyi text into Unicode.

## Open Fonts

This Google Code page contains several fonts including both Unicode-compatible and Zawgyi
Myanmar text.

Google Noto contains a font for Unicode-compatible Myanmar text.

## Checking accuracy

Some diacritics appear on the left of the character that they modify. You should see the capital of Myanmar, နေပြည်တော် start with a diacritic ေ which looks like the number 6. It should not place the န first.

## Detecting non-Unicode input

The knayi-myscript module for NodeJS can detect most Zawgyi text. It's easier to detect Zawgyi
when there is a larger string of text.

## Converting to and from Unicode

There are solutions available to convert between the two text formats.
The most common and up-to-date package is usually [Rabbit Converter](https://github.com/Rabbit-Converter), which is available in many programming
languages.

**NodeJS**

[Rabbit Converter](https://github.com/Rabbit-Converter/Rabbit-Node) is available as the 'rabbit-node' module.

[knayi-myscript](https://github.com/Rabbit-Converter/Rabbit-Node) is a Node module which can detect and convert between Unicode and Zawgyi.

The [knayi-cli command line tool](https://github.com/mapmeld/knayi-cli), based on knayi-myscript, can be used to convert Zawgyi text files to Unicode. Any Unicode-compatible text is left unchanged.

**PHP**

[Rabbit Converter](https://github.com/Rabbit-Converter/Rabbit-PHP) for PHP is the most
up-to-date of several PHP libraries.

**iOS**
